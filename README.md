## 🔬 About Me

I am a passionate research scholar at the intersection of **AI, Cognitive Neuroscience**, and **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**. Currently working on **Vision-Guided Robotic Arm Control using EEG/EOG signals**, I aim to build intuitive, asynchronous BCI systems to aid motor rehabilitation and interaction.

My work spans:
- EEG/fMRI data analysis  
- Brain encoding/decoding  
- Transformer-based burst signal analysis  
- Cognitive and motor task decoding  
- Vision + BCI integration for real-time applications

I'm currently interning at **ISC-CNRS, France**, as a **Charpak Scholar**, decoding imagined movement via **beta burst dynamics** in EEG.
